# The Hitchhiker's Lexicon

A personal, multi-language repository serving as both a digital toolkit and a knowledge base. This is where small programs, useful automation scripts, well-defined code snippets, and general notes are collected, refined, and organized for quick reference and reuse.

It is a digital toolkit and knowledge base that I've curated over time, with a focus on practical applications and insights gained from hands-on experience.

The focus is on practical utility and deep understanding (Lexicon), gathered from years of experience (Hitchhiker).
