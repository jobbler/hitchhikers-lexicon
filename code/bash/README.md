README.md in Each Language Directory

    Each language directory has a README.md file that:
        Describes the purpose of the directory.
        Lists the contents (e.g., functions/, scripts/).
        Highlights any notable files or conventions.
    Example: code/bash/README.md might say:

        "This directory contains Bash functions, scripts, and snippets. Functions are organized by purpose (e.g., code/bash/functions/networking.sh)."
